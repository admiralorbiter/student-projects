# Teacher Guide

This microsite is structured so you can quickly access grading expectations, team roles, and weekly milestones.

## Where to start
- Review the [Assessment Rubric](ASSESSMENT_RUBRIC.md).
- Share the [Student Guide](STUDENT_GUIDE.md) on day 1.
- Assign or confirm [Team Roles](ROLES.md).
- Use the [Weekly Schedule](SCHEDULE.md) to track progress.

## What to look for by week
- **Week 1:** Project skeletons, basic HTML/CSS/JS scaffolds, and initial logic functions.  
- **Week 2:** Editing/deleting data, localStorage integration, and responsive UI.  
- **Week 3:** Enhancements (categories, charts/progress, “what do I need?”, themes).  
- **Week 4:** Final polish, import/export, accessibility, and full testing coverage.

## Common checkpoints
- Clear data models, calculation accuracy, and meaningful validation.
- UI responds across breakpoints; accessible labels and focus states.
- Local storage saves and loads; export/import works as specified.
- Documentation: keep function docs and README updated as features ship.

## Demo script (15 minutes)
1. Show current data and grade/timer results in the UI.
2. Add an item (assignment or event) and explain validation.
3. Edit an existing item; show the UI and calculation/timer update.
4. Switch themes or views; demonstrate accessibility keyboard use.
5. Export data; then import to restore the same state.
