# UI Spec

## Layout
- Header: app title, current overall grade (percentage + letter)
- Left: input form (clear labels, validation messages)
- Center: assignment list (scrollable table with actions)
- Right: stats & tools (category breakdown, progress, “what do I need?”)

## Visuals
- Color-coded grade scale (A/B/C/D/F)
- Prominent current grade display
- Smooth transitions and hover/focus states
- Responsive breakpoints: desktop (3 cols), tablet (2 cols), mobile (single column)

## Accessibility
- Keyboard focus through all controls
- Proper labels/ARIA for dynamic content
- High contrast and no color-only indicators
