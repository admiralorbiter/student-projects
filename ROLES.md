# Team Roles & Responsibilities

Each team of 4 can mirror these roles (coordinate weekly integration):

- **Student A — Frontend (UI/Layout):** HTML structure, responsive CSS, components, theme system, modals.
- **Student B — Core Logic:** Calculations (grade) or countdown engine (timer), edge cases, accuracy tests.
- **Student C — Data Manager:** CRUD operations, rendering, localStorage, import/export, validation.
- **Student D — Features/Polish:** App wiring, feedback/notifications, charts/progress, settings, integration.

For detailed per-week task lists tailored to **both** projects, see the original task assignments provided to you and map them here as tickets.
